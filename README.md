Night of the Living Horror
=====

A game made with Crafty. Usually current version is hosted at [GitHub Pages](http://hilzu.github.io/notlh/). There is not much to it currently, just some moving cubes.

The CoffeeScript source can be compiled using
    $ npm install
    $ grunt coffee
or just manually compiling and placing the js files in the assets/js directory where RequireJS expects to find them.

This project is used to learn CoffeeScript and learn how the tooling of front-end JavaScript projects. Also I have newer made a proper game (not that this is anything related to proper yet but let's see what happens).
