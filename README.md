Night of the Living Horror
=====

A game made with Crafty. Current version is hosted at [GitHub Pages](http://hilzu.github.io/notlh/). The game is a work in progress.

The CoffeeScript source can be compiled using:

    $ npm install
    $ grunt coffee
    
Compiled sources are also available on the [gh-pages](https://github.com/Hilzu/notlh/tree/gh-pages) branch in the `assets/js` folder.

This project is used to learn JavaScript, CoffeeScript and how the tooling of front-end JavaScript projects work.
